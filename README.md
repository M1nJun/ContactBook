# ContactBook

This is my journey of learning python.

My goal is to make a simple contact book app. In the future, I want to make a simple messenger app that uses this contact book app. I will also learn Javascript, CSS, and HTML. When I get used to it, I want to learn React to make a good looking UI for these apps.

This app works on console.
You can sign up to the app or login if you already have an account in the system.

After the login, you will be asked for operations untill you choose to close the app.

You will have your very own contact data file in our system, which you can see the entire list by choosing 'show' operation.

To that file, you can add, remove, and edit.
